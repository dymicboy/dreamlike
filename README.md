<b>"Dreamlike"</b> means [“as if in a dream and therefore not real” from Cambridge Dictionary].<br>
We tried to make a dreamlike game which can give calm and peaceful feelings to the Player.<br>
Using Parallel Camera, you can experience ‘Optical Illusion Effect’ with equal ratio between camera’s xyz position.

"Dreamlike" is game using GLFW and other libraries.
